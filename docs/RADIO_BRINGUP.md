# Radio bring-up checklist

This checklist tracks the work required before MissionLink may use the SX1262 radio. It intentionally does not guess GPIO assignments or enable RF.

## Gate 0 — identify the exact hardware

- [ ] Record the exact XIAO ESP32-S3 board revision.
- [ ] Record the exact Wio-SX1262 module revision and connector arrangement.
- [ ] Verify the official pin map for the exact combination: SPI SCK/MISO/MOSI, chip select, reset, busy, DIO1/interrupt, and RF switch controls if present.
- [ ] Confirm voltage levels and power requirements from the hardware documentation.
- [ ] Confirm the antenna is the correct type and securely attached before any authorized RF testing.
- [ ] Confirm applicable Canadian radio requirements, permitted frequency/channel, bandwidth, spreading factor, output power, and duty-cycle constraints.

**Do not copy pin numbers from an unrelated SX1262 board.** Board variants can wire radio control pins differently.

## Gate 1 — compile-only integration

- [ ] Add a board-specific radio configuration header with verified pin assignments and source references.
- [ ] Keep `ML_RF_ENABLED` set to `0` by default.
- [ ] Add a compile-only RadioLib adapter behind the radio feature flag.
- [ ] Ensure the default build has no code path that initializes or transmits with the radio.
- [ ] Add host-side tests for packet framing and radio-independent state transitions.

A successful compile proves only that the code builds for the selected toolchain; it does not validate wiring or RF operation.

## Gate 2 — receive-only bench validation

Only proceed after the exact pinout and regional configuration have been independently verified.

- [ ] Initialize the SX1262 and report a structured status/error code.
- [ ] Read the radio chip/version information if supported by the module.
- [ ] Configure a compliant receive channel and verify that receive mode starts.
- [ ] Test reception using a known compatible, authorized test transmitter.
- [ ] Record configuration and results; do not claim a distance guarantee.

## Gate 3 — controlled packet test

- [ ] Review the complete over-the-air frame size, including nonce, authentication tag, and radio overhead.
- [ ] Implement authenticated encryption and replay protection before transmitting user messages.
- [ ] Add message IDs, duplicate suppression, acknowledgements, and timeout/retry behavior.
- [ ] Begin with a controlled point-to-point test under a compliant configuration.
- [ ] Test malformed packets and loss/retry cases before testing relays.
- [ ] Keep relay forwarding disabled until hop-limit enforcement and duplicate suppression are validated.

## Current status

The repository currently has a packet codec and USB/BLE command scaffold. Radio send/receive, production encryption, acknowledgements, and relaying are not implemented. RF remains disabled.
